## 🛠️ What’s Inside?

For **each dataset**, the following analysis pipeline is applied:

- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Interactive visualizations with Plotly Express — bar charts, boxplots, histograms, scatter plots, etc.

- 📈 **Descriptive Statistics:**  
  Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and distribution summaries.

- 🚨 **Outlier Detection & Treatment:**  
  Identifying outliers using visual tools and statistical techniques, with appropriate handling.

- 📊 **Probability Distribution Analysis:**  
  Distribution fitting via plots and statistical tests to determine normality or skew.

- ❓ **Hypothesis Testing:**  
  Use of ANOVA, t-test, and chi-squared test to answer meaningful domain-specific questions.

- 🧠 **Correlation Analysis:**  
  Heatmaps and coefficient matrices to uncover relationships between variables with real-world interpretations.

- 📝 **Insight Summary:**  
  Key findings from the data, supported by visuals and statistical evidence.
